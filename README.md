# High-Performance Node.js: From Event Loop Mastery to Production Observability - Workshop

Are you using NodeJS in Production?

If you do this is the right opportunity for you to solve most of your problems and make your life easier!

This intensive workshop dives deep into the advanced Node.js techniques that separate production-ready applications from hobby projects. Drawing from the expertise of Node.js core contributor Matteo Collina, you'll master the critical skills needed to build scalable, observable Node.js systems.

- Event Loop Optimization & Performance

- Strategic Caching Patterns

- Promise Pitfalls & Alternatives

- Worker Threads & Multithreading

- Production Metrics & Monitoring

- OpenTelemetry Integration

By the end of this workshop, you'll have the tools and knowledge to build Node.js applications that perform well under pressure, scale horizontally, and provide the observability needed for production operations.
